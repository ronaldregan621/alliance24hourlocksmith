# Prompt for Locksmith Website Design

Create a professional locksmith website for emergency lockout services using a modern service company design approach. The site should convey calm professionalism rather than crisis urgency, targeting people who are locked out and need reassuring, reliable help.

## Design Requirements

### Visual Style:
- Clean, professional appearance with blue/green color scheme
- Service "bubbles" - white cards with hover effects in a responsive grid
- Gradient backgrounds with subtle geometric patterns
- Modern typography hierarchy with clear section breaks
- Card-based layout with consistent spacing and shadows

### Content Structure:
1. Hero Section: Gradient header with main headline "Locked Out? We're On Our Way", phone number CTA, and 24/7 badge
2. Services Grid: 6 service bubbles covering vehicle lockouts, home/office, lock replacement, key duplication, safe opening, and emergency service
3. Trust Section: 4 trust indicators - fast response, licensed/insured, upfront pricing, professional tools
4. Process Steps: 4-step numbered process showing how the service works
5. Coverage Area: Geographic service area breakdown in grid format
6. Final CTA: Strong call-to-action section with phone number

### Key Messaging:
- Calm, professional tone (not emergency panic)
- "Help is on the way" reassurance
- Clear response times (under 30 minutes)
- No damage guarantee
- Upfront pricing promises
- 24/7 availability

### Technical Features:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Hover effects on service cards
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Click-to-call functionality
- Professional color gradients (blues and greens)
- Clean iconography throughout

### Emotional Goal:
Make stressed, locked-out customers feel relief that they've found competent, professional help rather than adding to their anxiety.
