### AskNYC-style locksmith emergency research (NYC market proxy)

Note: Direct r/AskNYC thread results were limited in this pass. Findings below synthesize common NYC user pain points and pricing expectations from reputable NYC-local sources and consumer reports that mirror AskNYC discussions.

### Core pain points (NYC emergency lockouts)
- **Bait-and-switch pricing ($19 promos)**: Low ad price, on-site upsell; drilling recommended too quickly; cash-preferred. Sources: Wikipedia on locksmith scams (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksmith_scam`), HN discussion referencing NYT/Reply All (`https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20237133`).
- **Fake listings/call centers**: Many Google listings route to generic dispatch; no storefront, generic phone greeting. Source: HN thread and Wikipedia (above).
- **Slow or uncertain ETAs**: Users report long waits or vague arrival windows at night; after-hours surcharges.
- **Unnecessary drilling**: Preference to drill/replace instead of non-destructive entry; damage concerns. Sources: HN thread; consumer anecdotes on CostHelper (`https://home.costhelper.com/locksmith.html`).
- **After-hours price shock**: Night/weekend fees stack with service, parts, and “labor” line items. Sources: Locksmith4NYC price list (`https://locksmith4nyc.com/price-list`).
- **ID/proof of residence anxiety**: Confusion about when ID is required to unlock apartments; fear of being denied service vs. safety. NYC tenant resources recommend proof of residence; police may assist in illegal lockouts. Sources: Legal Aid NYC (`https://legalaidnyc.org/get-help/housing-problems/what-you-need-to-know-about-illegal-lockouts/`), Met Council (`https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/illegal-evictions-illegal-lockouts/`).
- **Pricing opacity**: Users want firm quotes before dispatch; clear line items; card payments and receipts.
- **Trust markers**: Licensed/insured, local storefront or verifiable address, branded vehicles/uniforms, transparent policies.

### NYC pricing benchmarks (expectation setting)
- **Residential/apt lockout**: ~$145–$485 typical range (NYC) per price sheet; many consumers expect ~$125–$350 from blogs.

- **Automotive lockout (NYC)**: Starting ~ $165+; general national averages $30–$100 in guides but higher in NYC. Sources: Locksmith4NYC price list; CostHelper averages (`https://home.costhelper.com/locksmith.html`).
- **Service call/after-hours**: Service call $65–$195+; after-hours surcharges common (night/weekend/holiday). Source: Locksmith4NYC price list.
